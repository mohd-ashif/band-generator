band generator on node js 


A node js band generator is a program that uses node js to generate random band names. The program can be run on a local host at port 3000. To run the program, you will need to have node js installed on your computer. Once you have node js installed, you can clone the GitHub repository for the band generator and run the following command in the terminal:

npm install
nodemon index.js 
npm start
This will start the band generator program on your local host at port 3000. You can then open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to generate a random band name.
